<p>This is one of Danny's most difficult villains to fight because he was fighting an older more experience version of himself.Dark danny can use the phantom whale , duplicate himself , turn into gas , and all the other powers danny have except his ice powers.Dark danny basically took over the world and he didn't know how to take over one part of town because he did not know how to get past the ghost shield until he used the phantom whale.Danny traveled to the future and was attacked by his older self. Danny just couldn't beat him and then Dark danny threatend Danny's family's life and out of nowhere Danny learned the phantom whale and beat Dark danny.This episode was full of action and I'd go back and watch it myself.</p>
